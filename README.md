<h1>Patients Directory</h1>
<hr>
<h3>A very handy dynamic web application made for doctors who can use it to:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>add their patients, seeking appointment along with all their details</li>
  <li>create/update prescriptions</li>
  <li>update patient details as and when required</li>
  <li>update their appointment status</li> 
 </ul>
 <br>
 All this is being done on the fly with the help of JSP and Servlets, implementing MVC architecture. The codebase is almost entirely in Java along with basic HTML and CSS. More features will be added soon to provide more functionality, as well improve UI and UX.
